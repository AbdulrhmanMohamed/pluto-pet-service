        Many clients may also invite you to help yourself to a cup of tea and a biscuit while you’re there,
        but make sure you know what supplies are actually on offer. When doing daycare in a client’s home,
        I make sure to bring my own lunch and snacks in any case so I’m not tempted by their half-empty packet of Tim-Tams. `

        Of course there will be variations with every single pet and client and home, so it’s important to make sure you are prepared before each job.

        Bringing your pet in for a checkup may feel like a chore, but studies show that preventative care is essential to disease prevention and early detection of potential problems.
        Dogs and cats age much more rapidly than humans, so a lot can change in just a few months.
        We actually recommend general physical exams every 6 months, especially for pets older than 5 years of age.
        For puppies and kittens, we recommend having exams performed at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age.`

        which are damaging to your pet’s health and expensive to treat. There are many different ways for your dog or cat to contract parasites.
        Indoor pets can even be infected when their humans bring fleas in on their clothing or shoes!
        Fleas and ticks can be found at any time of year in the United States, so year-round prevention medication is essential.
        Dogs and cats can be exposed to heartworms in almost any location where mosquitoes can be found.
        Feline heartworm disease is especially dangerous; infected cats may die from the development of just one heartworm.`

        The reality is that dogs and cats are carnivores by nature, and their diet would consist of nutrient-dense,
        protein-rich foods such as organ tissue in the wild.
        We recommend pet foods with proteins such as chicken, beef, fish, and eggs listed among the first ingredients.
        Foods containing more meat and better quality ingredients have higher nutrient value and greater digestibility.`

        content : `Keeping your pet clean and well-groomed is an important part of complete pet care,
        so we are glad to see so many pet owners asking this question. But the truth is, the answer depends entirely on the breed and coat of your pet.
        For example, some dogs (such as poodles) will need to be professionally groomed every 4-6 weeks in order to keep their coats free of painful mats and tangles.
        On the other hand, short-haired dogs may be able to go 8-12 weeks between professional groomings, although they will still require regular upkeep at home.   
        Long-haired and medium-haired dogs and cats usually need to be brushed daily or every other day,
        while short-haired pets only require brushing once or twice a week. You should also keep your pet’s teeth,
        ears and nails clean and tidy with regular maintenance.`

        title : 'Why is it so hard to give a pet medicine?',
        content : `Here are some tips and tricks to make your life (and your pet’s life!) much easier and more comfortable when giving medicine. 
        If your vet says it’s ok for your pet to have the medication with food, this method is a possible option for some pets.
        Give your pet something they love to eat (check with your vet about what is safe to combine with the medication) around the time when they are hungriest. 
        The faster your pet gobbles the food down, the less likely they will notice any flavour.
        As such, bite-sized food often works well - such as a spoonful of wet food. Be sure to make sure your dog or cat has fully swallowed the pill and hasn’t spat it out,
        as their keen sense of smell may give the game away. For this reason, giving a pill directly is usually a safer bet to ensure your pet has taken its medicine. `
